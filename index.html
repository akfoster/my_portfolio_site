      <h4>Check out some of the projects I've worked on</h4>
      <a href="http://museum-archives.herokuapp.com/">Museum Archives</a>
      <p>The Museum Archives project listed items from a museum that were held in storage. It includes a picture and additional information for the item. I used the Victoria &amp; Albert museum's API to obtain the current information although I would like to expand this to other museums.</p>
      <a href="">Odeo</a>
      <p>Odeo was a group project that set up a website where users can record and upload sound clips of themselves singing, which could then be voted on anonymously by any user. The user who uploaded the clip can see an aggregate rating of their singing.</p>
